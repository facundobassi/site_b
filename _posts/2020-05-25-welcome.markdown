I set this place to show the results of some data analysis projects, which I found interesting. The idea is not forcing to create entries just to fill the page.


As of May 2020, I have mainly used basic `python`, the classical libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `pytorch`) and  `plotly` for the graphs.  


It is my intention you will find the posts useful, so please let me know if you have any comment or suggestion.

I will show later some code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
